    | S.No | Details |
    | --- | --- |
    | 1.a | Angular Application Setup. Observe the link on which the mCart application is running. Perform the below activities to understand the features of the application. |
    | 1.b | Components and Modules. Create a new component called hello and render Hello Angular on the page. |
    | 1.c | Elements of Template. Add an event to the hello component template and when it is clicked, it should change the courseName. |
    | 1.d | Change Detection progressively building the PoolCarz application. |
    | 2.a | Structural Directives - ngIf. Create a login form with username and password fields. If the user enters the correct credentials, it should render a "Welcome <<username>>" message otherwise it should render "Invalid Login!!! Please try again..." message. |
    | 2.b | ngFor. Create a courses array and rendering it in the template using ngFor directive in a list format. |
    | 2.c | ngSwitch. Display the correct option based on the value passed to ngSwitch directive. |
    | 2.d | Custom Structural Directive. Create a custom structural directive called 'repeat' which should repeat the element given a number of times. |
    | 3.a | Attribute Directives - ngStyle. Apply multiple CSS properties to a paragraph in a component using ngStyle. |
    | 3.b | ngClass. Apply multiple CSS classes to the text using ngClass directive. |
    | 3.c | Custom Attribute Directive. Create an attribute directive called 'showMessage' which should display the given message in a paragraph when a user clicks on it and should change the text color to red. |
    | 4.a | Property Binding. Binding image with class property using property binding. |
    | 4.b | Attribute Binding. Binding colspan attribute of a table element to the class property. |
    | 4.c | Style and Event Binding. Binding an element using inline style and user actions like entering text in input fields. |
    | 5.a | Built in Pipes. Display the product code in lowercase and product name in uppercase using built-in pipes. |
    | 5.b | Passing Parameters to Pipes. Apply built-in pipes with parameters to display product details. |
    | 5.c | Nested Components Basics. Load CourseslistComponent in the root component when a user clicks on the View courses list button. |
    | 6.a | Passing data from Container Component to Child Component. Create an AppComponent that displays a dropdown with a list of courses as values in it. Create another component called the CoursesList component and load it in AppComponent which should display the course details. When the user selects a course from the dropdown. |
    | 6.b | Passing data from Child Component to ContainerComponent. Create an AppComponent that loads another component called the CoursesList component. Create another component called CoursesListComponent which should display the courses list in a table along with a register button in each row. When a user clicks on the register button. |
    | 6.c | Shadow DOM. Apply ShadowDOM and None encapsulation modes to components. |
    | 6.d | Component Life Cycle. Override component life-cycle hooks and logging the corresponding messages to understand the flow. |
    | 7.a | Template Driven Forms. Create a course registration form as a template-driven form. |
    | 7.b | Model Driven Forms or Reactive Forms. Create an employee registration form as a reactive form. |
    | 7.c | Custom Validators in Reactive Forms. Create a custom validator for an email field in the employee registration form (reactive form). |
    | 8.a | Custom Validators in Template Driven forms. Create a custom validator for the email field in the course registration form. |
    | 8.b | Services Basics. Create a Book Component which fetches book details like id, name and displays them on the page in a list format. Store the book details in an array and fetch the data using a custom service. |
    | 8.c | RxJS Observables. Create and use an observable in Angular. |
    | 9.a | Server Communication using HttpClient. Create an application for Server Communication using HttpClient. |
    | 9.b | Communicating with different backend services using Angular HttpClient. Create a custom service called ProductService in which Http class is used to fetch data stored in the JSON files. |
    | 10.a | Routing Basics, Router Links. Create multiple components and add routing to provide navigation between them. |
    | 10.b | Route Guards. Considering the same example used for routing, add route guard to BooksComponent. Only after logging in, the user should be able to access BooksComponent. If the user tries to give the URL of Bookscomponent in another tab or window, or if the user tries to navigate without logging in. |
    | 10.c | Asynchronous Routing. Apply lazy loading to BookComponent. If lazy loading is not added to the demo, it has loaded in 1.14 s. Observe the load time at the bottom of the browser console. Press F12 in the browser and click the Network tab and check the Load time. |
    | 10.d | Nested Routes. Implement Child Routes to a submodule. |
    | 11.a | - A Complete MongoDB Guide  Module Name: Installing MongoDB on the local computer, Create MongoDB Atlas Cluster. Install MongoDB and configure ATLAS. |
    | 11.b | - A Complete MongoDB Guide  Module Name: Introduction to the CRUD Operations. Write MongoDB queries to perform CRUD operations on document using insert(), find(), update(), remove(). |
    | 12.a | - A Complete MongoDB Guide  Module Name: Create and Delete Databases and Collections. Write MongoDB queries to Create and drop databases and collections. |
    | 12.b | - A Complete MongoDB Guide  Module Name: Introduction to MongoDB Queries. Write MongoDB queries to work with records using find(), limit(), sort(), createIndex(), aggregate(). |
